# Grocery App

## Description of the Project

This project is a Spring Boot–based backend API for a Grocery e-commerce web application. It represents Version 2 of an existing online store and was completed as a capstone project with a focus on backend development, debugging, and feature enhancement.

The application supports common e-commerce functionality such as product browsing, searching, filtering, and user authentication. All development work is performed on the Java Spring Boot API, which connects to a MySQL database. A front-end web application is provided to demonstrate and test the API, but no front-end development is required.


## User Stories

- As a shopper, I want to view details for a single category, so that I can view what products it contains.
- As an administrator, I want to add a new grocery category, so that new product types can be organized properly.
- As an administrator, I want to update an existing category, so that I can correct or improve category information.
- As an administrator, I want to delete a category, so that outdated or unused categories can be removed.
- As a shopper, I want the product search and filter functionality to return accurate results, so that I can easily find grocery items that match my selected criteria.
- As an administrator, I want updating a product to modify the existing record instead of creating duplicates, so that product information remains accurate and consistent.
